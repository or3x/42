## Releases
In the “dist/” directory there are folders for each release. In each release folder there is an apk-file, release notes and a Test Report (release 2 and onwards). 

For the final scrum documents and the Post Mortem Report, see the “docs/reviewcandidates” folder.
The documents for earlier sprint can be found by traversing the Git history. This is easily done by using the tags for each release.


## Our scrum tools
Scrum board - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/909894
Please note that there are more stories in the icebox, and that the tool automatically moves tasks from the backlog to the current sprint. 

## Other
Please observe that you can not test the app on Eduroam as it does not allow anything but well known protocols. Any other network, including mobile hotspots should work.
